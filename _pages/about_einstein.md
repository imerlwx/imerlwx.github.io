Hi there!

My name is Wengxi and I'm a research assistant at Stanford University, supervised by [Prof. Hari Subramonyam](https://haridecoded.com/) at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). My research interests lie in human-AI interactions, systems, and collaborations that can augment human capabilities in daily life. From a high-level perspective, the main question in my mind: **How to design interfaces that can facilitate the communication of knowledge and intent between humans and AI?**

Two aspects:
+ How to design human-AI systems such that they are understandable and controllable
+ What are the scenarios that AI is well suited for helping us do tasks

I am actively seeking for PhD opportunities in North America in Human-Computer Interactions (HCI). If you'd like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to email me at wengxili@x, x=umich.edu, or on X/LinkedIn!

Previously, I got my Master degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where my main direction was semiconductor and nanotechnologies. I also got a Master degree in [Medical Physics](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/ucl-medical-physics-and-biomedical-engineering) at the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) supervised by [Dr. Antonio Stanziola](http://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/antonio-stanziola) and [Prof. Bradley Treeby](http://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/bradley-treeby) where I worked on [Therpeutic Ultrasound and Computational Modelling](http://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/research).

My undergrad was at the [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/), where I studied [Physics](https://physics.bnu.edu.cn/) and also worked as a Research Assistant at the [Novel Device Lab](https://btmm1.bnu.edu.cn/laoshizhuye/NDL/English.htm) doing research in semiconductor devices.

I’ve also worked on a few fun coding projects, which you can view via my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/imerlwx).

When I’m not staring at a screen all day, you can always find me hiking in the mountain. # live in nature ✌️
